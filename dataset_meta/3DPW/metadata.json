  "description": "AMASS unifies 15 different optical marker-based mocap datasets, representing them in a common framework and parameterization using the MoSh++ method. This converts mocap data into realistic 3D human meshes represented by a rigged body model (SMPL). The dataset contains over 40 hours of motion data, spanning more than 300 subjects and over 11000 motions.",
